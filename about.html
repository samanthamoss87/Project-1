        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Please click the question below to reveal the answer</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item" data-toggle="faq-1">
        <p>1. Do you offer a wide range camera solutions?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          One size rarely fits all. Every fleet is different in terms of vehicle make-up and usage, so make sure your
          preferred partner has the tools available to create a video telematics solution that meets your precise needs.
          Having access to a wide range of connected forward-facing vehicle cameras, multi-channel cameras, mobile DVRs
          and blindspot/cyclist detection systems compliant with FORS & DVS makes it possible to take a tailored and
          flexible approach to your fleet requirements.


        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item" data-toggle="faq-2">
        <p>2. Is your software platform device agnostic?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          You really donâ€™t want to end up with multiple systems just to use your vehicle cameras. Choosing a hardware
          agnostic platform means the software is compatible with all forward-facing and multi-camera solutions, mobile
          DVRs and FORS/DVS systems, as well as third-party technology such as tracking or electronic vehicle systems.
          This ensures all the video footage and supporting telematics data is in the same place, whatever hardware
          solution you select, so you can make the most of your investment.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" data-toggle="faq-3">
        <p>3. Is the software developed and supported in-house?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Find out if your video telematics partner owns the software or if they are dependent on a third- party
          manufacturer. This is a critical consideration, especially if the software needs to be installed locally
          rather than being in the cloud, because new updates or any issue resolution could end up being a painstaking
          process. Also, if the software is not designed and maintained within the EU, you will need consider the
          implications with regards to your GDPR responsibilities and internal IT policies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" data-toggle="faq-4">
        <p>4. Do you use lithium batteries within your camera technology?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Lithium-Ion batteries in vehicle cameras are suspected of causing a number of fires in parked cars as a result
          of overheating, in one instance prompting a recall of as many as 85,000 devices in Japan. There is a real risk
          to both your drivers and fleet assets, so it is worth considering supercapacitor batteries as an alternative
          battery back-up. A supercapacitor can operate safely at more extreme temperatures.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item" data-toggle="faq-5">
        <p>
          5. Do you provide any complementary support services?

        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Check whether any complementary services are available alongside a video telematics solution, so you can make
          the most of your connected vehicle cameras. We have found, for example, that some fleet operations lack the
          resources internally to review and respond to multiple alerts. If this sounds familiar, then it might be worth
          considering support services such as a monitored FNOL (First Notification of Lost) solution that can
          significantly reduce claim reporting times, better manage claims costs and unlock the true savings potential.
          These support services is something RS Vision consulting can provide.
