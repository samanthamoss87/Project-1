    - This is the inital design i created. I was going to implement a Management page in this project, but as i wanted it to sit in the About us section as an accordian which i know is a Javascript element so i decided to wait for project 2 to implement.  

# Features
## General features

- This Banner is on all pages except the main page
- The Banner is on every page for continuity throughout the website and to highlight we specialise in Technolgy including API's. 

## Future Implementations
## Accessbility
**Audio**

- I created Audio script on the main sections of the website for Visually impaired people and people with learning difficulties. After doing some reseach and talking to people who was effected by been visually impairment and a Managing Director of a blind charity for children they commented saying it was forward thinking and really positive approach to be inclusive of all individuals. They mentioned they wish all websites would adopt a similar approach. 
- As my website expanded i will increase the amount of Audio where required. 
- I also created the NAV Bar to be fixed on all pages, so it is easy to access all elements no matter what page you are on.
