        Works; and</p>
      <p>(c) the use of the Works or the Intellectual Property Rights in the Works by Client will not infringe the
        rights
        of any third party, and confirms that the Individual has given written undertakings in the same terms to the RS
        Vision Consulting
        Limited.</p>

      <p>7.5 The RS Vision Consulting Limited agrees to indemnify Client and keep it indemnified at all times against

        the

        to terminate the Engagement or to accept any breach of this agreement on the part of the RS Vision Consulting
        Limited
        as having brought the agreement to an end. Any delay by Client in exercising its rights to terminate shall not

        Confidential Information, and as such, must be deleted from personal social or professional networking accounts;
        and</p>
      <p> (c) provide a signed statement that it or he has complied fully with its or his obligations under this clause
