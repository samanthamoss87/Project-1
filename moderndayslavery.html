        <p> Transparency Statement
            RS Vision Consultancy Limited has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, corruption, and human rights abuses. Training and awareness have been a key area of focus thereby ensuring both our employees and supply chain is fully alert to the scale of the issue, the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and as modern slavery is not just a 9-5 issue, how to spot instances of modern slavery and how to report it.
            This transparency statement describes our business and supply chain, our policies covering ethical behaviours, and our standards. It describes the steps we have taken to, insofar as is possible, ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our suppliers, partners or in our own business. In 2023, we progressed our approach and supported the identification and education of modern slavery. Our pledge to conduct our business in an ethical and responsible way is crucial to our continued success. It is essential for building trust with clients, shareholders, suppliers, and business partners. It also matters to our people, who want to work for an organisation with a strong, uncompromising ethical stance. We are committed to taking appropriate steps to do what we can to detect and prevent any forms of slavery.
